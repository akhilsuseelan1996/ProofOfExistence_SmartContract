# ProofOfExistence


Proof of Existence will help to prove that a certain document/file/media was created on a particular date and time. Imagine you have invented a new technology, for example something like the Blockchain. You have all of the working materials and resources in a single PDF and this invention has a perspective to make you a Nobel laureate or at least a rich person. However, you are scared to share your invention with other people or companies as you feel that they may steal it and claim their rights for the invention.

In this case, you would need to patent an idea, deal with loads of paperwork and delayed processes. Providing that you are not familiar with the procedure, it would also take plenty of time to understand how the whole mechanism works.

Thatâ€™s where Proof-of-Existence comes into the game. You can get the ownership of your invention/idea/prediction and prove it everywhere, independent from your location. No prior technical knowledge is required to do this.

Intellectual property is not the only thing you can protect with PoE.
